# SnakeGameRefactor
<p>This is the C++ refactor of a simple snake game, which is a cw written in JAVA and mainly focused on Refactor and OOP designing
However, I have glanced some OOP design methods and patterns and class structure design. However, adapting them correctly and knowing when to use them is much difficult than I thought.
Thus, this is a refactor of that cw.

<br> based On EasyX, a simple graphics library.
<br> Be cautious: there are some Chinese comments, which sometimes leads to compilation failure. Removing the nearest comments of where fail could be a way.
