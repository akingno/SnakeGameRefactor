# SnakeGameRefactor
<p>The C++ refactor of a simple snake game, which is a cw written in JAVA and mainly focused on Refactor and Design Patterns.
However, I have glanced some patterns and class structure design but adapting them correctly and Knowing when to use them is much diffi than I thought.
Thus, this is a refactor of that cw.
